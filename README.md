# Password Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to make it easier to create multiple passwords to increase my security when making accounts. Instead of having to come up with different passwords for different sites you can just use the password generator and copy and paste into your notepad to remember it. From this project I learned a lot about how to work with Javascript and how to use randomization within Javascript.
